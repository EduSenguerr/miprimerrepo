# miprimerrepo
Este es mi primer repositorio para las clases de Git.

I added this to show how to make a commit from GitHub.

"I have added another line to show how 'fetch' works."

I have added another line to show how 'pull' works.

"I modified this to prove that it is not possible to push without pulling first."
